## Learn some eBPF for greater good

There is a trend in writing eBPF programs for cloud native infrastructure to achieve things that were previously considered impossible. This topic is aimed at eBPF novices interested in getting their feet wet by writing some useful eBPF program from scratch.

**Stretch goal:** prepare workshop that can be submitted to conferences / offered to our customers because it is a hot topic and there is an opportunity to enable enhanced learning to developers

## Repository content

./headers - basic eBPF C headers for efficiently writing eBPF programs
./uprobe\_call\_detect - example with uprobe and function argument inspection
